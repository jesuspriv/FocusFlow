Dashboard UI layout practice using HTML & CSS (Flexbox & Grid)

# FocusFlow – UI Layout Practice

FocusFlow is a personal project focused on practicing modern UI layout design using
HTML and CSS.

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of layout systems,
spacing, visual hierarchy, and building scalable interfaces similar to real-world
web applications.

This project is not focused on functionality yet, but on creating a solid and clean
UI foundation.
