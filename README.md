# FocusFlow – UI Layout Practice

FocusFlow is a landing page layout created as a practice project to improve my
HTML and CSS skills.

The main objective of this project is to focus on layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy
and responsive design, not on building a fully functional product.

This project is not focused on functionality yet, but on creating a solid and clean
UI foundation.
